Used Stack Data Structures with C++ to learn Deterministic Pushdown
Automata (DPDA) 

The program accepts a string belonging to a language or
rejects a string not belonging to the language. The program is to read a description of a DPDA and
one input for it. It will process an input and output the execution path. After processing one string, the
program reset the automata (this includes emptying the stack if necessary) and proceed with
the next string.
